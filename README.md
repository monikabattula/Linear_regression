####LINEAR REGRESSION###
Mainly One have to find the 
   --MEAN ABSOULTE ERROR
   --MEAN SQUARE ERROR
   --ROOT MEAN SQAURE ERROR and
   --R2SCORE
####NAIVE BAYESIAN#####
In this there are performance metrics like
  
######K-NN######
  --Euclidean Distance:

    Measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
    Formula: ∑i=1n(xi−yi)2∑i=1n​(xi​−yi​)2

  --Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm):
        
        Measures the sum of absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of points.
        Formula: ∑i=1n∣xi−yi∣∑i=1n​∣xi​−yi​∣
